Task Management App

ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Task Management App is a Kanban-style board where users can create, update, organize, and track tasks. It includes authentication, task CRUD operations, activity logs, drag-and-drop functionality, and filtering/sorting features. The app follows modern front-end best practices, including clean architecture, modular design, error handling, and unit testing.

ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites

1. Add Firebase Configuration

Before running the app, create a Firebase project and add your Firebase config in firebaseConfig.js:

// firebaseConfig.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
